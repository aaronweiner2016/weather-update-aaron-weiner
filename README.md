# weather-update-aaron-weiner
-This project was my first attempt to access an API on my own. There were some difficulties figuring out how to go into two different ones to get the city name and then coordinates. I think this project helped me gain a deeper understanding for processing javascript code and strengthening my skills further. Also with helping me learn more about getting data out of API's.</br>
